                                get to do just that. I want to build lots of useful things in my lifetime, and long-term
                                be a key part of building at least one big useful thing (probably a software company).
                                Product is synergistic with that long-term goal: it lets you practice building, just
                                within a narrower scope.

                                STEM immigration is by far the single greatest lever the United States has to improve
                                its long-term prosperity. The ability to attract highly skilled immigrants is America’s
                                greatest advantage - and we squander it.
                                <p>Countless examples of immigrants who had
                                    massive impact- Katalin Karikó (messenger RNA/Covid vaccine), Elon Musk (Tesla,

                                    Sergey Brin (Google) show that just one immigrant can drive the creation of hundreds
                                    of thousands of jobs, technological advancement, and health breakthroughs. Yet we

                                <b>Defense and Security.</b> I’ve long been interested in foreign policy and defense. I

                                and have
                                long followed foreign affairs closely. Simply put, I don’t believe order is a given. Yet
                                all prosperity is founded on the basis of security; given that, security seems a rather
                                high impact area. At the same time, since the “last supper” in 1993, it appears our
                                superbly consolidated defense industry has become too unwieldy to build the modern and
                                intelligent hardware-software platforms that I think will define warfare.

                                Before I started my first full-time job in consulting, I got pretty good at selling cars
                                for Tesla (ask me for my 1-minute sales pitch). In consulting, I worked on EV charging
                                station buildout strategy for Exelon; I also joined the <a

                                used to
                                work at, Optoro, has a mission to drive sustainability in the retail space by building
                                solutions to efficiently handle returns, which there are rather a lot of as the shift to
                                e-commerce continues.

                                Today, I believe that without nuclear for baseload generation, we will continue to be
                                wedded to generation via fossil fuels.

                                <b>Real Estate.</b> My first internship was at a real estate private equity firm, JBG
                                (now JBG Smith, NYSE: JBGS). I also closed in April 2020 on the sale of a SFH I bought a
                                few years ago. I’ve always found real estate a fascinating asset class, not least for
                                its prominent role in American notions of success and prosperity.
                                <p>
                                    I generally believe that in most cases, real estate investing is not a great way
                                    for individuals to generate differentiated, risk-adjusted returns¹, especially in
                                    most
                                    major cities. I think the most compelling case to make for it is on the basis of
                                    appreciation (supplemented by income), yet only in exceptional situations. <a

                                    point; e.g., SF). Recent examples include migration to SF for tech and migration
                                    from SF

                                us, the value of AI came from automation, from labor efficiency in use cases where tons
                                and tons of relatively simple decisions need to be made and the data was already
                                structured.

                                More recently, I helped my brother launch <a href="kawaiiapp.net">Kawaii</a>, an app
                                that’s reached the top 25 in

                                into college I actually thought I’d be a career diplomat. To that end, I did NSLI-Y and
                                then took a gap year to serve with AmeriCorps, teaching math and reading to 1st, 2nd,
                                7th, 8th, and 12th graders in rural Washington State. I spent a lot of that year at the
                                top of a mountain reading philosophy, policy, and politics books. I’m still learning
                                about policy across energy, redistribution, taxation, and the like.

                                of good deals across equities and fixed income. I'm also really into personal finance

                                points (remnant of my time in consulting). I also manage cash flow and do the books for
                                my brother's app business and set up his S-corp and solo 401k.

                            1. Real estate investing also involves a host of tax considerations, from the mortgage
                            interest deduction to qualified business income deductions and depreciation, but I omitted
                            those here, focusing purely on the viability from a cash return standpoint. My thinking
                            generally is that tax considerations usually don’t move the needle sufficiently to flip an
                            investment from a “don’t do” to a “do”, especially relative to other investments. I
                            generally prefer to think of these considerations, as well as the availability of leverage,
                            as tailwinds to boost the exceptions I mention vs. reasons to make the investment in the
                            first place.
